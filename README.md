Music makes the world go around. Use this helpful site to view gifs of some of your favorite artist of today and yesterday. I have already provided a few of my own. How to use:

1.Either click the already made buttons or type in an artist and create your own button.

2. When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

3.  When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

4. The gif will display the rating.

5. Have fun!!!
